Quick start to run BaLM : 

1. Define how many workers (nc) to intialise in run_multiple_chains.m 
	This defines how many chains can be run simultaneously (either on the same problem or for different problems)
	e.g. we run 32 workers, for four problems (8 chains on each problem) for any given run of the code. 
	
2. Define what files you want to run for each test (chain), go to import_files.m (see our examples already here). 

3. Change any parameters within the parameters.m file. 

4. Define which modules you want to include (i.e. do you want to include data selection ? and do you want to include the non-linear deformation?) You MUST include the affine transformation and permutation vector sampling. 
   Do this in the run_matching.m file .
